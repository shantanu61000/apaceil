                  <li>Moveable assets can be either hypothecated by way of charge or mortgage. Generally, the mode/form of creation of 
                    security on moveable fixed assets, specific machinery, current assets, receivables, is by way of hypothecation. 
                    There is no delivery of the assets/delivery of possession of the assets / properties by the security provider to the 
                    hypothecatee (i.e. person in whose favour the security is created).
                  </li>
                  <li>A “fixed charge” is a charge where specific identified moveables are secured in favour of the lender (e.g. specific
                     item of machinery/equipment, vehicle etc.). In the case of a fixed charge, the property charged must be described, and 
                     the information of the existence of the charge thereon must be specified on the property itself/place where the 
                     property is installed/stored/lying, e.g. by affixing a board/notice thereon.
                  </li>
                  <li>A “floating charge” is an equitable charge on the assets for the time being of a going concern. It attaches to the 
                    subject charged in the varying condition in which it happens to be from time to time. An essential term of such charge
                     is that the security provider may continue to use its assets in the ordinary way until the charge is crystallized, when
                     it fastens on the underlying assets. The charge, so to say, is kept latent and dormant, till it crystallizes by the
                     happening of some event which fixes the charge, e.g. liquidation/bankruptcy/insolvency of the security provider or the 
                     appointment of a receiver for taking possession of the charged property, or default by the security provider/borrower, 
                     which would entitle its holder to take action for the enforcement of the security.

              <ul>
                  <li>Pledge is a kind of bailment where an asset is delivered as security for the repayment of a debt. The person
                     who offers the security is called the <strong>“pawner”</strong> or <strong> “pledgor”</strong> 
                      and the bailee is called the  or <strong> “pawnee”</strong>  or <strong> "pledgee".</strong> 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The ingredients of a pledge are the delivery of the properties/assets being pledged to the pledgee (i.e. person in 
                    whose favour the security is created), with the intention of creating security thereon, coupled with the authority to 
                    deal with or dispose of the said property.
                  </li>
                  <li>A pledge can be created in respect of any tangible moveable property – goods, stocks, jewellery, etc.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In case of shares/securities held in physical form, the deposit of the relevant certificate along with duly signed
                    blank transfer forms (with endorsement of the concerned Registrar of Companies, where applicable) will be required to
                    be made to the pledgee. Blank transfer is valid only for 3 months, hence the same needs to be revalidated.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It must also be noted that certain securities may not be pledgeable – e.g. certain types of units, etc., or certain
                    specific approvals may be required e.g. shares of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) where the Memorandum of such SPV 
                    restrict transferability, etc., or certain conditions may be required to be met for the same – e.g. shares under lock-in,
                    etc.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If an equity for the project is brought in stages, the same need to be tracked and ensured pledge cover is maintained by
                    xecution of additional pledge documents, for execution of additional pledge same process such as availability of corporate
                    resolutions, filing form W etc. to be completed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Capital structure of the company (whose shares are taken as security) need to be verified and ensure that security cover
                    is maintained at all times. If capital is in the form of preference, CCDS etc., pledge of the same need to be explored 
                    by credit and business.
